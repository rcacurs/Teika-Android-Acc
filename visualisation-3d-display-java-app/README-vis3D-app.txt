Program for connecting to shape reonstructing sensor system
and saving shape model in wavefron format in real time. .obj file
generated by this program are intended for visualisation on LightSpace 
volumentric display

! Sensor systems bluetooth device must be paired with OS bluetooth
manager

program execution:
    java -jar vis3D-app.jar

Program work flow:
    1) program outputs list of paired bluetooth devices. 
    2) user must input index of device corresponding to SmartWear device
    3) surface reconstruction is srated in programs continuously creating two files
       modelTemp.obj and model.obj. model.obj file is the file intended to be read by
       outside programs. When outside program has read this file, the program should
       delete this file (this program then will create new file with latest data).
    4) while processing 'save' command can be issued to save reference state (needed for coloring)
    5) to quit program 'quit' command must be issued
